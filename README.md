# 🐼 Pandas Beginner Practice (with Git Commits)

This repository is a **step-by-step Pandas learning project** designed for beginners.  
The goal is to learn Pandas **incrementally**, using **real Git commits** for each concept, just like in real-world data projects.

## 📄 Dataset Description

### `employees.csv`
This is the **original dataset** used for learning Pandas basics.

**Columns:**
- `id` – Unique employee ID  
- `name` – Employee name  
- `age` – Employee age (contains missing values)  
- `department` – Department name  
- `city` – City of work  
- `salary` – Annual salary  
- `joining_date` – Date the employee joined  

This dataset is intentionally small and slightly messy to help practice:
- Missing values
- Filtering
- Grouping
- Date handling

---

### `updated_employees.csv`
This file is **generated by the analysis script** after:
- Filling missing values
- Adding new calculated columns
- Cleaning and enriching the dataset

**New Columns Added:**
- `bonus` – 10% of salary  
- `tax` – 5% of salary  
- `salary_after_tax` – Salary after tax deduction  
- `joining_year` – Year extracted from joining date

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project covers the following Pandas concepts:

- Loading CSV files
- Inspecting datasets (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
- Selecting columns
- Filtering rows with conditions
- Handling missing values
- Creating new columns
- Sorting data
- Grouping and aggregation (`groupby`)
- Working with dates
- Saving processed data
- Using Git commits to track learning progress

---

## 🐍 analysis.py

This file contains **all Pandas learning steps**, built incrementally through Git commits.

Each commit focuses on **one concept**, including:
1. Loading the dataset
2. Inspecting data
3. Filtering and selection
4. Data cleaning
5. Feature engineering
6. Aggregations
7. Date handling
8. Saving final output

Run the script using:
```bash
python analysis.py
